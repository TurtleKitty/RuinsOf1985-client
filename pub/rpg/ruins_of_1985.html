<h2> Ruins of 1985 </h2>

<p>
There was a time of great progress and prosperity.

<p>
Crop yields were blessed.  Ships and traders brought goods
and ideas from all over the known world.  Universities
flourished with inspiration and invention.  Great cosmopolitian
port cities raised towers to the sky.

<p>
Prosperity fed population.  Over generations, those with greater
luck or skill came to possess more land than those without.  As
the natural resources of the land became monopolized by fewer
and fewer, the many began to suffer under the heel of oppression
and serfdom.  There was grumbling, crime, and talk of revolution.

<p>
The aristocracies of different nations faced similar problems.
The nobles took more and more land for themselves, leaving the
poor and dispossessed ever more numerous.  Every freeholder
thrown off their land and made a serf became a potential rebel.
How could the nobility protect their power and privilege?

<p>
The solution was simple.  The leaders of various nations got
together and planned a splendid little war.  It would eliminate
the excess, unneeded laborers while providing grand sport
to the military men.

<p>
Armies marched.
Mages burned cities and summoned monsters from other worlds.
Sorcerers blinded whole populations with their colorful and imaginative lies.

<p>
The weakness of arrogance was apparent as things spun out of the
leaders' control.  War led to famine, as various armies took what
they needed from peasants by force, leading peasants to devour
their seed grain.  Famine led to diseases few could fight off.
Pestilence added the final nail in the coffin, and 99 out of 100
living souls perished in the space of a decade.  The wars began
in the year 1950; society collapsed by 1980.  All of the old
nations had fallen.  Entire cities were abandoned. Developed lands
went back to the wild.

<p>
In 1985, small groups have banded together at the local level.
Towns are being rebuilt.
Some have begun to go out and explore.  There are untold
treasures waiting to be found in ruins - not just gold and silver,
but works and art and books of forgotten knowledge worth their
weight in gold.

<p>
Towns hire mercenaries to defend themselves from the raids
of roving bandit gangs. Strange monsters roam the land, leftovers
from forgotten wars.  Heroes work to restore lost knowledge and
temples.

<p>
There is much to do.
