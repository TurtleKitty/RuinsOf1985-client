<h2> Mages & Sorcerers </h2>

<p>
This chapter describes the rules for casting spells.

<p>
<b> Requirements </b>

<p>
In order to use a spell against a person or object, the user must be
able to sense the subject in some way.  This usually means being able
to see or touch the target.

<p>
Casting a spell takes at least a full round.
The caster must stand relatively still (moving no more than 1 free space) and concentrate.
This does not affect his defense.

<p>
<b> Skill </b>

<p>
Supernatural ability is divided into two camps: the <b>Mage</b>, and the <b>Sorcerer</b>.
Mages cast spells affecting the physical world, while Sorcerers weave spells involving the mind.
Though the powers differ, the mechanics are similar.

<p>
The Mage rolls his Intellect trait to determine if a spell succeeds.
If aimed at a space, the challenge level is 4 plus any range penalties.
If aimed at a person, the Mage must roll against the target's Dodge or Parry.
If the target is a Mage, they may deflect the spell; substitute their Intellect (+7) for Dodge or Parry.

<p>
The Sorcerer rolls his Presence trait to determine if a spell succeeds.
He must roll against the Defiance of the target (Intellect or Intuition +7).
If the target is a Sorcerer, they may deflect the spell; substitute their Presence (+7) for Defiance.

<p>
To make an offensive spell work, the caster must make a trait check as above.
The caster makes only one roll, even if there are multiple targets.
Subjects are affected once per round for the duration of the spell.

<p>
<b> Power and Energy </b>

<p>
Every magic user has a power level that represents the base amount of supernatural
energy he can channel in a single round.  This is based on Willpower.
</p>

<div class="example">
Power = Willpower + 10
</div>

<p>
Every spell has an energy level.
One can cast spells of energy greater than their power level in a number of ways.

<p>
One point of Fortune is worth 1 point of energy.

<p>
A mage can sacrifice his health for power: 1 point of energy per wound inflicted on himself.

<p>
A sorcerer can sacrifice her sanity for power: 1 point of energy per shock inflicted on herself.

<p>
Either can cast spells beyond their power level by taking extra time.
Each +3 energy requires roughly a doubling of the time required to cast the spell.
A concentrating spellcaster may do nothing else except move 1 space per round.

<p>
Channeling too much power can be dangerous.
One who concentrates for an hour or longer must make a Fortitude roll versus the hour +7 -
8 at hour 1, 9 at hour 2, etc.
Failing this roll makes the spell backfire.
For Mages, this means taking an energy blast equal in power to the extra energy summoned so far - 
28 at hour 1, 31 at hour 2, etc.
For Sorcerers, it means taking a horrify attack of the same magnitude.
Normal defenses apply.

<p>
It is possible for multiple magic-users to cooperate in the casting of a 
single spell.  One caster (generally the most powerful) acts as the
leader; he receives +3 to his power level for each doubling in the number
of followers - one follower gives +3, two followers gives +6, four followers
gives +9, etc.  Followers must possess the same form of supernatural ability
(Mage or Sorcerer) as the leader.

<p>
There may be objects or locations that give mages or sorcerers a bonus to their power level.
The Adversary should be creative.

<p>
<b> Attacks </b>

<p>
The damage from an attack spell is based on its intensity.

<p>
Impact attacks subtract the victim's Protection from the damage.
The result is the number of wounds inflicted.

<p>
Energy blasts subtract the victim's Fortitude from the damage.
The result is the number of wounds inflicted.

<p>
Horrify and Torment spells subtract the victim's Willpower from the damage.
The result is the number of shocks or wounds inflicted.

<p>
<b> Holds </b>

<p>
The power of a Disorient spell, a Telekinetic grapple, a Daze, or a Delusion is based on its intensity.
If the spell roll is successful, the victim is held fast. For TK holds, this
makes the target immobile, incapable of and vulnerable to physical attacks, but
does not affect the target's ability to cast spells, deflect Mage spells, or defend against mental attacks.
For Daze or Delude spells,
the target is senseless and defenseless; he can do nothing except attempt to break
free.  Disoriented or deluded entities can move and act, but can't sense their surroundings.

<p>
To escape a telekinetic hold, the subject rolls his Brawn vs 7 + the intensity of the spell.
For Daze or Delude spells, the subject rolls Willpower.
For Disorient spells, the subject rolls Perception.

<p>
The victim gets a free chance to escape the moment the spell is cast.
After that, the victim can attempt to escape once per action (twice per round).
If the roll succeeds, the character is free and can act normally on their next action.

<p>
<b> Nullify </b>

<p>
Spellcasters may attempt to nullify hostile spells with their own.
The nullifier must concentrate for a full round and make a trait check versus the Intellect (mage) or Presence (sorcerer) of the caster.
If successful, the nullifier must expend an amount of energy equal to the energy of the spell he wishes to destroy.
This can be used in response to instantaneous spells if the caster has not used up his actions for the round. 

<p>
Mages and Sorcerers can only nullify spells of their own kind.  

<div class="example">

Nik the wise has a Willpower of 6.  He can cast a spell of energy 16 in one round.
If he wants to cast a spell of energy 19, he has options: he can burn 3 points of
Fortune, inflict 3 wounds (or shocks, if he's a Sorcerer) upon himself, make his
apprentice join him in a group ritual, or take an extra round to cast the spell.
An energy 22 spell would require 6 Fortune, 6 wounds or shocks, two apprentices, or four rounds.

</div>

<div class="example">

<p>
The mage Vunata has the initiative and wishes to make Juk and Tam suffer.
He has a Willpower of 6, giving him a Power level of 16.
He attacks with a fiery blast: intensity 13, area 2 (to hit both enemies), and duration 2 (he wants them to suffer longer).
This spell requires 19 energy, so Vunata burns 3 Fortune to cast it.

<p>
Vunata rolls a 9 and adds this to his Intellect (5) for a total of 14.
Juk has a Dodge of 14, so the spell affects him.
Tam, a mage, has an Intellect of 8, giving her a defense of 15.
She deflects the spell from herself.

<p>
Juk subtracts his Fortitude (8) from the damage of the spell (13) to get 5.
This would cause 10 wounds, but Juk burns his last 5 points of Fortune to escape them.
The spell has a duration of 2, however, so Juk is affected again on the next round.
He takes 5 wounds.

</div>

<div class="example">

<p>
Alzeimer the Sane wants to open a gigantic portal to the plane of Uggae to bring horrors into the world.
The portal he has in mind will have 100 spaces in area (horrors are big) and last for over an hour (horrors are slow).
Adding base portal cost (10) to the energy needed for an area 100 portal (30) and that needed for a duration of 1 hour (28) gives an energy of 68.

<p>
Alzeimer's Willpower is 6.  His base power level of 16 is not high enough to open this portal. At all.
To achieve his ridiculous dream, he recruits 4 apprentice mages to act as acolytes for his death cult.  This gives him +9 power during rituals.
He spends 10 rounds in a group ritual to open the portal, giving him +10 energy.
He burns his 30 Fortune for 30 more energy.
Last but not least, he inflicts 3 wounds on himself for +3.
His power level is now 68, enough to cast the spell.
