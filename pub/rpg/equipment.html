<h2> Equipment </h2>

<p>
<b> Economics </b>

<p>
In the game, money is usually in the form of precious metals such as copper, silver, and gold.
One coin weighs around 10g (100 coins per kilogram).

<p>
The price of a good or service differs from time to time, from place to place, and from person to person.
This price depends upon the relative value of both goods, values which derive from individual desires and relative scarcity.
The prices in this chapter, therefore, should be taken as a reasonable estimate for a normal town under normal conditions.
The Adversary should feel free to adjust prices to reflect the relative scarcity of goods as the players travel to different places.
On the wild frontier, for example, gold and silver may be worthless compared to the necessities of survival.
This will mean that the price of everything (as measured in gold or silver) will be much higher than in a safer place.

<p>
It is useful (for game purposes) to consider copper, silver, and gold as trading at fixed rates of one hundred to one:
1 gold coin (gc) = 100 silver coins (sc) = 100 copper coins (cc).

<p>
Prices are listed in terms of copper coins (cc) - the common man's metal.

<p>
<b> Encumbrance </b>

<p>
There are limits to the amount of gear and loot one can carry.

<p>
A character's Brawn trait determines the maximum amount of weight that person can heft.
A large haul gives penalties to movement and to any traits requiring agility, including dodge and parry.
The penalty is based on the ratio of weight carried to maximum lift:

<table>
    <tr><th>Weight : Max Lift (%) </th><th> Penalty </th></tr>
    <tr><td>        30%           </td><td>    -3   </td></tr>
    <tr><td>        60%           </td><td>    -6   </td></tr>
    <tr><td>        90%           </td><td>    -9   </td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Encumbrance penalties stack with armor penalties.

<div class="example">
Example: Bob has a Brawn of 3.  He can lift 100kg.
When carrying more than 30kg of gear or treasure, he has -3 to his movement and to any traits requiring agility.
When carrying more than 60kg, he has a -6.
When carrying more than 90kg, he has a -9.
When holding up 100kg, he is immobile.
</div>

<p>
For purposes of simplicity, rough estimates are better than detailed accounting.

<p>
<b> Weapons </b>

<p>
Weapons are used to slay enemies.

<p>
<b> Melee Weapons </b>
are for hand-to-hand combat.
They have two scores: Defense and Power.
The wielder adds a weapon's Defense to his Parry.
Melee weapons do Brawn + Power damage.

<p>
<b> Thrown Weapons </b>

<p>
Any item can be thrown at an opponent.
Most do damage equal to the character's Brawn, though fragile items may do less (and break upon impact).
Objects of excessive mass or awkward size and shape may give penalties to hit.
Weapons designed to be thrown have no such penalty and add their power to the user's Brawn.
Thrown weapons require one hand to use.

<p>
<b> Missile Weapons </b>

<p>
Missile weapons use leverage to launch projectiles.
Slings, bows, and crossbows fall into this category.

<p>
The advantage of missile weapons is that they project power at long range.
The drawback is the need for ammunition -  a missile weapon is usually limited to around two dozen shots per battle.
It is assumed that ammunition can be recovered or recreated between battles, given sufficient time.

<p>
Missile weapons do Brawn + 9 damage.
Adventurers are assumed to have weapons to match their Brawn.

<p>
Missile weapons require two hands regardless of size.

<p>
These names are only suggestions.
Weapon names and cosmetics are not important for game purposes. 
Players are free to call their adventurer's weapons whatever they like.

<p>
An adventurer who uses a shield in his off-hand gets +2 to Parry.

<p>
An adventurer who wields two one-handed weapons gets the damage bonus of the larger, +1 to hit, and +1 Parry.


<p>
<b> Armor </b>

<p>
Armor protects the wearer from physical harm in combat.

<p>
Armor can be a lifesaver, but is heavy and uncomfortable.
The armor's Protection is added to the wearer's Fortitude for purposes of resisting damage from physical attacks.
Armor slows a character down and makes many actions difficult (running, climbing, jumping, sneaking) or impossible (swimming).
The penalty of the armor should be subtracted from movement, dodge, and any trait checks that require movement, agility, or quiet.
This does not include fighting skills - armor is designed for it.

<p>
The mass of the armor determines the protection.
The cosmetics of the armor are not important for game purposes.
Players may call their character's armor mail, plate, chain, or boiled hide, so long as the weight and discomfort are the same.
The list below is a general guideline.

<table>
    <tr><th> type           </th><th> protection </th><th> penalty </th><th> weight </th><th> cost   </th></tr>
    <tr><td> leather        </td><td>    3       </td><td>  -1     </td><td>    20  </td><td>  200   </td></tr>
    <tr><td> chain          </td><td>    6       </td><td>  -3     </td><td>    40  </td><td>  2000  </td></tr>
    <tr><td> plate          </td><td>   10       </td><td>  -5     </td><td>    60  </td><td>  20000 </td></tr>
