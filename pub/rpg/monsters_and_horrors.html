<h2> Monsters and Horrors </h2>

<p>
When creating monsters, The Adversary should not feel restrained by the 
character creation rules.  Monsters and horrors are often far larger 
and more powerful than the heroes, and there is no reason why 
otherworldly creatures cannot have powers unavailable to the players.

<p>
Below are some pointers for creating interesting monsters.

<p>
<b> Size </b>

<p>
Normal player characters are considered to be human, or at least 
vaguely so.  The size and density of monsters is measured relative to 
this standard, with humans being of Size and Density 0.

<p>
Monsters are often different.  This makes the monsters frightening to the players, which is a good thing.

<p>
A creature twice as tall as a human would have roughly eight times the
mass, assuming similar density.  This is important to note for the sake
of grappling or weak floors.

<p>
Great strength does not necessarily make one any less vulnerable to
harm - an elephant is very strong, but can still be chopped into small
pieces if hit with an axe enough times.  Fortitude should be limited
unless the creature is made of sterner stuff than most.

<p>
By the same token, one does not want a giant monster to be easily
killed.  In order to make creatures tough without making them
invulnerable, The Adversary can give them Fortune to absorb wounds or
allow them to suffer more wounds before incapacitation.

<p>
Some creatures may have proportions that make their strength different
for different purposes.  A long-limbed creature might have greater strength
for striking than for lifting.  A tentacled creature could have a powerful grip,
but a weak punch.

<p>
<b> Armor </b>

<p>
Some creatures are tough, but not strong.  If The Adversary wishes to
create a monster that can take damage better than it can dish
it out, he can make armor a natural part of its anatomy by giving
the critter different Fortitude traits for withstanding damage,
healing wounds, and resisting poisons.

<p>
<b> Extra Limbs </b>

<p>
There is no reason why extraplanar horrors need to be limited to two 
arms, two legs, and one head.  There is nothing wrong with making your
players fight an otherworldly octopus monster with eight heads and
sixty-four tentacles.  How this translates into game terms (such as
improved Initiative or hundreds of attacks per round) is up to The
Adversary.

<p>
<b> Extra Senses </b>

<p>
Monsters need not be limited to normal human sight, sound, smell, touch,
or taste.  A monsters may see infrared light, "see" via ultrasonic waves
like a bat, or have some sort of supernatural spatial awareness.

<p>
<b> Flight </b>

<p>
Monsters need not be earthbound like the heroes.  A monster could have 
great wings that allow it to fly, or it could levitate via unknown forces.
Care should be taken, as melee specialists may be rendered useless if
the flier can attack from up high.

<p>
<b> Regeneration </b>

<p>
Monsters and horrors may have rates of recovery far superior to the 
natural healing of a human.  A monster could recover wounds and shocks
once per round instead of once per week, perhaps even without rest. 
This makes monsters harder to kill, which makes them more frightening
to the players.  This is a good thing.

<p>
<b> Powers </b>

<p>
There is no reason why monsters need to be limited to the same spells
as humans.  While some monsters may indeed use energy blast or daze spells,
some might also have special abilities such as shapeshifting, invisibility,
or mind control.  Some monsters may even be immune to physical or supernatural
attacks (but not both, unless The Adversary wants a monster to be indestructable).

<p>
For that matter, there are supernatural arts appropriate for human 
antagonists that are not listed in the rules.  This is 
because these abilities are not available to player characters.
It is fine for The Adversary to make use of golems, undead, potions, and 
the like, but players should not know where they come from.
Mystery is fun.

<div class="example">

<p>
The Adversary wishes for his players to be attacked by a horde of undead terrors.
These creatures are immune to reason or passion and obey orders without question.

<p>
He decides on two types: ghosts and skeletons.
Ghosts are immune to physical attacks and attack the players with Horrify spells.  
Skeletons are immune to mental attacks and attack the players with rusted swords and armor.

</div>

<p>
<b> Alien Intellect </b>

<p>
Humans are not the only creatures who can use spells to travel between
worlds.  Some monsters may come to this world of their own ability.  One
that does is the most frightening of opponents - it is alien, wields 
supernatural powers, and has its own reasons for being here.
