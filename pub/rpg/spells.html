<h2> Spells </h2>

<p>
This chapter describes the rules for creating spells.
For those who wish to skip this section, there are example spells in <b>Chapter 4.</b>
Rules for using spells are in <b>Chapter 3</b>.


<p>
<b> Skill </b>

<p>
Casting a spell requires a trait roll: Intellect for a Mage spell, Intuition for a Mystic spell.
The character rolls this trait to determine if a spell succeeds.

<p>
<b> Energy </b>

<p>
Every spell has an energy level based on its base cost, intensity, area, and duration.

<p>
<b> Intensity </b> <br>
The raw force of a spell.  For attacks, this translates into damage.
Each level of intensity adds one to the energy level to a spell (minimum one).

<p>
<b> Area </b> <br>
By default, spells are directed at a single individual or space.
A caster may choose more targets: adding 3 to the energy level of a spell
doubles the area.  Targets need not be adjacent.

<p>
<b> Duration </b> <br>
By default, spells are fleeting - they are thrown, defended against, and
resisted in one round.  Spells may last longer: adding 3 to the energy
level of a spell doubles the duration.

<p>
Spells are composed of one or more powers from the Mage or Mystic side.
Each power component of a spell has its own intensity, but all share
the same area and duration.


<p>
<b> Mage Powers </b>

<table>
    <tr><th>Name</th><th>Base Energy</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Alter</td><td> 0 </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Barrier</td><td> 0 </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Disorient</td><td> 5 </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Energy Blast</td><td> 5 </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Impact Attack</td><td> 0 </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Telekinesis</td><td> 10 </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Portal</td><td> 10 </td></tr>
</table>


<div class="trait">
<b> Alter </b>
is used to change the mage's environment.
It can be used to create light, heat, cold, white noise, and various other minor environmental stimuli.
The intensity of an alteration determines how dramatic the difference can be.
An intensity 0 alteration allows the mage to create a soft light, lower the temperature by a few degrees, make a quiet noise, etc.
Each +3 doubles the effect.
</div>

<div class="trait">
<b> Barrier </b>
allows a Mage to place a wall of pure force.  The intensity of the barrier is subtracted from any physical attack passing through it.
Anyone who wishes to push through the barrier much make a Brawn roll greater than the barrier's intensity, then spend a number of
movement points equal to the intensity.
</div>

<div class="trait">
<b> Disorient </b>
lets a Mage hit a foe with an intense blast of light and sound, stunning them. The target can still move and act,
but is blinded and deafened - any actions requiring sight or hearing should have harsh penalties (like -3 or more).
The target remains disoriented until the duration expires or he makes a Perception roll greater than 7 + the intensity
of the spell.  This can be attempted once per action.
</div>

<div class="trait">
<b> Energy Blast </b> summons heat, cold, sound, lightning, or some other alteration of energy to smite foes.
The intensity of the blast determines the damage inflicted.
Armor is useless against energy, but Fortitude protects as normal.
</div>

<div class="trait">
<b> Impact Attack </b>
allows a Mage to hurl a projectile with telekinetic force.  The intensity of the spell detemines the damage.  This is a normal physical
attack, so armor and barriers are protective.
</div>

<div class="trait">
<b> Telekinesis </b>
allows the Mage to use force at a distance.
The Intensity of the spell determines the effective Brawn the Mage can use.
This can be used to grab and hold a person or object, then throw or slam them,
just as with ordinary Brawn.
</div>

<div class="trait">
<b> Portal </b>
lets a Mage open glowing, elliptical doorways between separate points in physical space.
These portals can be used to bypass obstacles or to visit other realms.
The amount of energy required to create a portal is determined by the size of the portal 
and the duration for which the portal will stay open.
An energy level of 10 can create a portal the size of one space that lasts for one round
(a mage can opt to have a portal of lesser size, but it still takes a minimum of ten energy).
Each +3 energy can be used to double the area or the duration of the portal.

<p>
Upon casting, the mage chooses the size of the portal and the place that it will connect to.
The near side must be adjacent to the Mage; the far side can be anywhere the Mage can sense.
The difficulty of an portal spell depends on the distance between the two points - the challenge
level is equal to 3 + 1 per 5 spaces of distance.
If the portal is to another world, the "distance" is chosen by The Adversary, as he must decide how
much otherworldly travel He wishes to allow in his campaign.

<p>
Portals are symmetric.
When a portal is created, individuals on both sides will see a glowing gateway and a glimpse of what lies on the other side.
Anyone who can reach the portal, from either side, can go through it.
Not only that, but the portal in each world is two-sided - this means, for example, that a portal opened from dry
land to a place that is underwater will cause water to spew in two opposite directions, not one.

<p>
Mages on either side of a portal may try to nullify it.

<p>
Portals can be used to gather allies from other worlds.
The ability to locate exotic creatures, however, does not automatically allow the mage to make friends with them.
One who wants an otherworldly servant should be prepared to bribe, bully, or beg - and things from another world may not speak the magic user's language.

<p>
If one steps through a portal into another world, walks ten miles, then steps through another portal to get back to the first world,
he will find himself ten miles from the spot where he stepped through the first portal, in the same direction that he was walking in the other realm.
Thus, portals may be used to avoid certain physical barriers or known dangers of our world, but it will not save much time if used this way - and
other worlds have barriers and dangers of their own.

<p>
The topography of different realms is not the same.
When opening a portal at an unfamiliar location, a mage will often find that his portal is high
above the ground, underground, or underwater in the world he desires to visit.

<p>
This power does not confer any special life support 
upon a traveller - if the user opens a portal to a place filled with 
a harmful substance (lava, acid, or the pressurized water at the 
bottom of an ocean), he will probably destroy himself and his 
immediate area.

<p>
There untold numbers of parallel realms.
The mage who plans on exploration ought to have some knowledge of
the place to be reached before attempting to travel there - to open a portal 
to a random world that the caster knows nothing about is suicidal.

<b> Mystic Powers </b>

<table>
    <tr><th>Name</th><th>Base Energy</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Daze</td><td> 10 </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Horrify</td><td> 5 </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Obscure</td><td> 10 </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Torment</td><td> 5 </td></tr>
</table>


<div class="trait">
<b> Daze </b>
allows a Mystic to render an enemy senseless and defenseless.
The target must make a Willpower check greater than 7 + the intensity
of the spell in order to escape before the duration expires.
</div>

<div class="trait">
<b> Horrify </b>
lets the Mystic attack a foe's mind.  The intensity of
the spell is compared to the target's sanity to determine the
number of shocks inflicted.
</div>

<div class="trait">
<b> Obscure </b>
lets the Mystic summon a cloud of fog, or insects, or
something similar to obscure vision.
</div>

<div class="trait">
<b> Torment </b>
allows the Mystic to attack a foe's body with a swarm of stinging
insects, painful boils, uncontrollable itching, fever and chills, or something similar.
The intensity of the spell is compared to the target's Fortitude to
determine the number of wounds inflicted.
