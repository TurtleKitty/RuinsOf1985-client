<h2>Attribute checks</h2>

<ul>      
  <li>The attribute check is the fundamental mechanic of the game: <b>2d6 + Trait/Skill</b> </li>
  <li>This is compared to the opponent's trait + 7 or a challenge level set by The Adversary. </li>
  <li>The difference between the trait check and the challenge level is the <b>margin</b> of success or failure (<b>mox</b> for short).</li>
  <li>A roll of 2 is an automatic failure.</li>
  <li>A roll of 12 is an automatic success with a minimum mox of 1.</li>
  <li>If a situation does not require a roll (because success is trivial), then the character's trait level is the mox.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Combat </h2>

<ul>
  <li>Combat is handled by dividing time and space into discrete units.</li>
  <li>Time is measured in rounds.  Each round is six seconds in duration.</li>
  <li>Space is measured in spaces.  Each space is an area two meters across.</li>
  <li>
    Characters have a number of combat values based on their traits, gifts, and equipment:

    <ul>
      <li> Movement is equal to Athlete + 10.  The character's encumbrance and armor penalty are subtracted from this.  </li>
      <li> Initiative is equal to Perception.  </li>
      <li> The Trait or Skill check used for offense is based on the type of attack.
        <ul>
          <li> Missile weapons use Archer. </li>
          <li> Hand-to-hand and thrown attacks use Warrior. </li>
          <li> Mage and Sorcerer spells use Intellect. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Dodge is equal to 7 + Athlete - armor penalty.  </li>
      <li> Parry is equal to 7 + Warrior + weapon defense.  </li>
      <li> Defiance is equal to 7 + max(Intellect or Intuition).  </li>
      <li> Protection is equal to Fortitude + armor.  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> To attack a foe, the player rolls his Offense vs the defense of the target (Dodge or Parry, whichever is higher). </li>
  <li> On a hit, damage is calculated by adding the mox of the attack roll to the attacker's Brawn and weapon power.  Subtracting the target's Fortitude and armor gives the number of wounds inflicted.</li>
  <li>
    Characters normally get two actions per round.  One or both can be sacrificed for bonuses:

    <ul>
      <li>
        One action:
    
        <ul>
          <li> Aim: +3 to the next attack</li>
          <li> Defend: +3 to Dodge and Parry for the round</li>
          <li> Haymaker: +10 damage to the next melee attack</li>
          <li> Resist: +3 to Defiance</li>
          <li> Look: +3 to Perception</li>
        </ul>

      </li> 

      <li>
        Two actions:
        
        <ul>
          <li> Total Defense: +6 to Dodge and Parry</li>
          <li> Total Defiance: +6 to Defiance</li>
          <li> Watch: +6 to Perception</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Injury</h2> 
      
<ul>
  <li><b>Wounds</b> represent physical damage. A person who has ten or more wounds is incapacitated and may die.</li>
  <li><b>Shocks</b> represent mental damage caused by psionic attacks or psychological trauma.  A person who has ten or more shocks is bordering on madness and may lose his mind for good.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fortune</h2> 

<ul>
  <li>Improve a Trait and Skill check: sacrifice 1-5 points of Fortune for an equal bonus to a roll.</li>
  <li>Haste: sacrifice up to 5 points of Fortune for an equal bonus to initiative.</li>
  <li>Run like the wind: sacrifice up to 3 Fortune for an equal number of spaces in a movement action.</li>
  <li>Rapid attack: sacrifice 3 Fortune to make two attacks with a single action.</li>
  <li>Absorb Wounds and Shocks: a player may use Fortune to absorb wounds and shocks: 1 point of Fortune per point of damage avoided.</li>
  <li>Heal: Adventurers with the Mystic gift may burn Fortune to heal themselves and others, 1 point per wound or shock healed.</li>
  <li>Increase supernatural power: A player may sacrifice Fortune to power a spell, 1 point of Fortune for 1 point of energy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Spells</h2> 

<ul>
  <li>Use of a spell takes a full round.  The caster may do nothing else except move one space.</li>
  <li>Every spell requires a certain amount of energy.  A Mage or Sorcerer may increase the intensity, area, or duration of a spell by expending extra energy.</li>
  <li>A spell user's base power level is the amount of energy he can channel per round: 10 + Willpower </li>
  <li>A caster may gain extra energy for a spell by sacrificing Fortune, taking extra time, or inflicting damage on himself.</li>
</ul>
