<h2> Fortune </h2>

<p>
Fortune is that strange, intangible thing that sets adventurers apart from ordinary people.
It allows characters to succeed where they should have failed and escape harm from blows that should have killed them.
It can represent divine favor, magical protection, mystical guidance, sheer tenacity, or dumb luck - whatever the player likes.
One point of Fortune costs one character point.

<p>
Powerful villains and monsters may have Fortune as well.

<p>
Fortune allows The Adversary to alter the power level of the game.
An Adversary who wants a high-powered game can give each character some bonus Fortune for free.
One who wants a gritty game can limit Fortune or forbid it altogether.

<p>
Mechanically, Fortune can be used for a number of things:

<div class="trait">
<b> Improve Trait and Skill checks </b>

<p>
A player may chose to sacrifice 1 to 5 points of Fortune for an equal bonus to a trait or skill roll.  This decision must be made before the dice are thrown.
</div>

<div class="trait">
<b> Haste </b>

<p>
One determined to go first can spend up to 5 Fortune for an equal bonus to Initiative.


<div class="trait">
<b> Run Like The Wind </b>

<p>
An individual may spend up to 3 Fortune to add an equal number of spaces to a move action.  One who uses both of his actions to move may spend 3 Fortune each action for a total of six extra spaces in one round.
</div>

<div class="trait">
<b> Rapid Attack </b>

<p>
A warrior or archer may sacrifice 3 Fortune to make two attacks with a single action.  One who uses both actions to attack could spend 6 Fortune for four attacks in one round.
</div>

<div class="trait">
<b> Absorb Wounds and Shocks </b>

<p>
When a character takes damage, the player may use Fortune to absorb wounds and shocks: 1 point of Fortune per point of damage.
Whether to burn Fortune or take the damage must be decided at the time of the blow.
</div>

<div class="trait">
<b> Bless and Heal </b>

<p>
Adventurers with the Mystic gift may transfer their Fortune to others.
They can also burn Fortune to heal themselves and others, 1 point per wound or shock healed.
If they have a willing donor, they can transfer Fortune, wounds, or shocks between the donor and another person to bless or heal them.
</div>

<div class="trait">
<b> Increase Supernatural Power </b>

<p>
A player may sacrifice Fortune to power a spell, 1 point of Fortune for 1 point of energy.
