<h2> Conflict </h2>

<p>
Conflict is an essential part of any story.  The world would be dull without it.

<p>
<b> Challenge Levels </b>

<p>
The following table should give The Adversary some guidance on assigning
challenge levels.

<table>
    <tr><th>Task Difficulty</th><th>Challenge Level</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Trivial       </td><td align="center">  3 </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Mild          </td><td align="center">  6 </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Fair          </td><td align="center">  9 </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Moderate      </td><td align="center"> 12 </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Great         </td><td align="center"> 15 </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Incredible    </td><td align="center"> 18 </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Inconceivable </td><td align="center"> 21 </td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The numbers above assume that the character has the necessary
tools for the job in question - i.e., if a thief is trying to pick a
lock, then he is using a standard lockpick.  If the thief was trying
to pick a lock with something nonstandard, like a dagger, then The
Adversary should make the challenge level higher.
If the character has an exceptional set of tools at his disposal, The
Adversary should lower the challenge level a notch or two.

<p>
The numbers also assume that the character is taking a normal amount
of time to perform the task.  What this amount is depends upon
the task - perhaps six seconds for picking a lock or six
days for smithing a weapon.

<p>
Characters can obtain bonuses for extra time taken or penalties for rushed work.

<table class="display-table">
    <tr><th> Extra time </th><th> Bonus </th></tr>
    <tr align="center"><td>  x2  </td><td> 3 </td></tr>
    <tr align="center"><td>  x3  </td><td> 5 </td></tr>
    <tr align="center"><td>  x4  </td><td> 6 </td></tr>
    <tr align="center"><td>  x5  </td><td> 7 </td></tr>
    <tr align="center"><td>  x6  </td><td> 8 </td></tr>
    <tr align="center"><td>  x8  </td><td> 9 </td></tr>
    <tr align="center"><td>  x10  </td><td> 10 </td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Frex, one can get +3 to the trait check for taking twice as long as usual
or +6 for taking four times as long.  If the character tries to rush, The
Adversary should increase the challenge level by 3 for for each halving of the
required time. 


<p>
<b> Perception </b>

<p>
Perception is used whenever The Adversary wants to see whether a 
character notices something, such as images, sounds, or smells that 
are hard to detect because they are small, faint, or far away.
It is used to determine whether a character will notice subtle sensory input, 
like someone sneaking up behind him.

<p>
Various factors can affect a perception check.
Bright light or pitch darkness can hamper vision.
Loud noise can hamper hearing.
The challenge level for any situation is up to The Adversary.

<p>
Unconscious characters get no perception checks - they are senseless.
Being asleep is not the same as being knocked out, however; sleeping
characters get normal hearing checks when unusual noises occur
in their presense.  If successful, they awaken.
If the noises are very soft, such as someone sneaking toward the sleeper, the perception rolls are more difficult.

<p>
Perception is also used when The Adversary wants to see whether a character 
notices something subtle that is right in front of them, such as an 
enemy wearing a disguise or someone following them through a crowd.  
Anything that distracts the character from paying careful attention to
detail could cause a penalty (a higher challenge roll).


<p>
<b> Intuition </b>

<p>
Intuition functions as supernatural perception.

<p>
This is a catchall for supernatural abilities used to learn the unknown.
A mystic may hear the whispers of spirits, read the future in the stars, or simply know things without reason.
It allows one to sense the presence of nearby disembodied spirits and to communicate with them on a primal level.
One does not receive coherent thoughts from ghosts, only urges, feelings, and desires.

<p>
Intuition can be used by The Adversary as a plot device.
He can allow a character to sense danger, receive visions of the future, or anything else that adds to the game.

<p>
<b> Combat Values </b>

<p>
Adventurers have a number of combat values based on their traits, skills, gifts, and equipment.

<ul>
  <li> Movement is equal to 10 + Athlete.  The character's encumbrance and armor penalties are subtracted from this.  </li>
  <li> Initiative is equal to Perception.  </li>
  <li> Offense is based on the type of attack.
    <ul>
      <li> Missile weapons use Archer.  </li>
      <li> Hand-to-hand attacks and thrown weapons use Warrior.  </li>
      <li> Mage and Sorcerer spells use Intellect.  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Dodge is equal to 7 + Athlete - encumbrance and armor penalties.  </li>
  <li> Parry is equal to 7 + Warrior + weapon defense bonuses.  </li>
  <li> Defiance is equal to 7 + Intellect or Intuition, whichever is greater.  </li>
  <li> Protection is equal to Fortitude + armor.  </li>
</ul>

<p>
<b> Initiative </b>

<p>
At the beginning of each battle, characters roll initiative to determine who
acts first.  High initiatives act before low ones. The order will remain for
the battle unless someone chooses to Haste.

<p>
Environmental factors (such as surprise) or minor actions (such as
darting a single space or drawing a weapon) may give bonuses or penalties
to initiative.

<p>
Any trait bonuses or penalties that result from a character's actions last until the next round.


<p>
<b> Action </b>

<p>
The next step is the action phase.
Characters take their turns in order of initiative, highest to lowest.
A character disabled before his turn gets no actions.

<p>
Some actions, such as drawing a weapon, shouting to a comrade, or moving a single space, take little time and require no trait roll.
if such actions must be done before more important ones, the character might have a penalty to Initiative.

<p>
Other actions do require a trait roll or take significant time.
A character may take two such actions per round of conflict.
For example, a character can move and attack, attack and move,
move twice, attack twice, open a door and run down the hallway,
jump off a ledge and tackle someone, etc.

<p>
Some actions may require more time to complete.  Casting a spell takes a full round.


<p>
<b> Round Zero </b>

<p>
Round zero marks the beginning of any conflict.
Whoever acts first automatically gets the initiative.
This usually applies to a single individual, but can apply to a group in cases of ambush.
After the initial round zero activity, conflict progresses to round 1 and participants roll initiative.

<p>
If the initiating individual or group has taken their opponents 
completely by surprise, then the opponents may take no actions at all 
on round zero - not even defensive ones.  This simulates situations 
such as ambushes or knives thrown by hidden assassins.

<p>
Surprised characters get no trait added to their defense.  The challenge
level to hit an unaware character is a flat 4 plus any range modifiers.
Sneak attacks can be deadly - the only defense is not to be caught unaware.

<p>
<b> Movement </b>

<p>
A character may move a single space per round without using an action.
He may move a number of spaces equal to his Movement by expending an action.

<p>
Other moves - standing from a prone position, mounting an animal, making a leap, etc - take one action.

<p>
A character who is sitting or lying down is prone - he gets +3 defense against ranged attacks, but can
move only 1 space per round.  Others get a +3 to hit him with melee attacks and +3 defense against his attacks.
Falling prone is a free action.

<p>
A mounted character uses the mount's movement in place of his own.
Horses and such generally have twice the movement of a humanoid, or even more.

<p>
If the ground is not level, The Adversary may give a character bonuses or penalties to his movement.
If the terrain is treacherous, The Adversary may require an Athlete roll (on foot - a rider may
need to roll Ranger to control his mount).

<p>
Individuals may sometimes need to jump over things.  The Adversary should
require an Athlete roll with a challenge level of 4 * the number of spaces.

<p>
Charging characters may add their momentum to the damage of an attack.
This works both ways, however - a charging character will take the same additional damage from any enemy melee weapon that hits him on that round.
Momentum gives (and takes) +1 damage for every 3 spaces of movement.
Whether to charge in with momentum or slow down and stop before attacking is up to the player.

<div class="example">

    <p>
    A brave knight charges a line of soldiers atop his mount.  His
    lance does 13 damage (9 for the lance + 4 for Brawn).  The knight has
    moved 28 spaces on horseback, however, so adds 9 for a total of 22.

    <p>
    Unfortunately, the knight is hit by one of the braced spearmen, whose weapon
    gives him a damage of 10 (1 for Brawn, 9 for the pike).  Adding the knight's
    momentum to this gives a total of 19.  Good thing the knight is wearing his
    shining armor.

</div>

<p>
Combat movement is automatic.  When finer detail is required - for races
or chases - participants should roll Athlete.  Each level of mox gains
the victor one space of distance.

<p>
<b> Range </b>

<p>
The further away a target is, the harder it is to hit. 
Ranged abilities have challenge numbers based on distance (zero at point-blank range).
These numbers are added to the defense of the target.

<p>
Ranged abilities are either Short or Long.
Short-range abilities suffer a +1 to the challenge level for every space between the adventurer and the target.
Long-range abilities suffer a +1 for every five spaces.

<table>
    <tr><th> type     </th><th> range </th></tr>
    <tr><td> thrown weapon   </td><td align="center">  short          </td></tr>
    <tr><td> missile weapon  </td><td align="center">  long           </td></tr>
    <tr><td> spell       </td><td align="center">  long   </td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
Senses are also limited in range.  Olfaction is Short.  Hearing, vision, and intuition are Long.

<div class="example">

Bows are long-range weapons.
If a target is within 5 spaces, the challenge number is 0.
If a target is between 6 and 10 spaces, the challenge number is 1.
Between 11 and and 15 spaces, it is 2.
Targets will have these numbers added to their Dodge or Parry.

</div>

<p>
<b> Abort </b>

<p>
A character with actions remaining who is attacked may sacrifice actions for bonuses in response to the attack,
even if it happens before the target's initiative.  This intent must be declared before the dice are rolled.

<p>
<b> Wait </b>

<p>
A character is not required to act on his initiative.  He can wait to see
what others with lower initiatives will do.

<p>
A waiting character may take its action at any time, even within the
action of another character.

<div class="example">

<p>
Juk the Barbarian sees Mace the Ugly on a hilltop across the
battlefield.  Juk wins initiative, but waits to see what Mace will do.

<p>
Mace charges.  Juk won the initiative, however, so he may choose to
attack first after Mace has covered the distance between them -
he was only waiting for his enemy to get close enough to strike.  If
Mace survives the attack, he may then take the rest of his action.

</div>

<p>
A waiting character may also hold action until the next round, in which case
that character gets +10 to initiative for that round.
He gets no extra actions, however.

<p>
<b> The Waiting Game </b>

<p>
This rule simulates scenes in books and movies in which two opponents 
stop and stare one another down, taking no actions, in the middle of
a fight.

<p>
If two characters both decide to wait for the other to act and there 
are no other characters with actions left, then the action passes to the
next round.  This can even involve more than two characters.
All characters involved in the waiting game get the initiative bonus
over characters who acted in the previous round.
